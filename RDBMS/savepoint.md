The SQL syntax for creating a savepoint is as follows:

```sql
SAVEPOINT ee;
```

A savepoint allows you to set a point within a transaction that you can roll back to later, without rolling back the entire transaction. Here's an example usage:

```sql
BEGIN;

-- Some SQL operations
INSERT INTO employees (name, position) VALUES ('Alice', 'Manager');

SAVEPOINT ee;

-- More SQL operations
UPDATE employees SET position = 'Director' WHERE name = 'Alice';

-- Rollback to savepoint if needed
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT ee;

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```
