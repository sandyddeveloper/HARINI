8 (a) Explain different types of joins with examples.

1. INNER JOIN:

Description: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.

Example:

SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.id;



2. LEFT (OUTER) JOIN:

Description: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.

Example:

SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.id;



3. RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN:

Description: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.

Example:

SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.id;



4. FULL (OUTER) JOIN:

Description: Returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned.

Example:

SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.id;



5. CROSS JOIN:

Description: Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, i.e., every possible combination of rows.

Example:

SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
CROSS JOIN departments;
