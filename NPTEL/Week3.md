### **1. Software Modelling Overview**
- **Software Modelling** is the process of creating a visual or logical representation of a system to be developed. These models serve as blueprints for building software and help in understanding, designing, and communicating complex system components.
- Modelling ensures that all stakeholders (developers, project managers, clients) understand how the software will work before development begins.
- One common way of modelling is through the **FBS (Function, Behaviour, Structure) framework**, which helps outline what the system should do, how it behaves, and how it's structured. Additionally, tools like **UML (Unified Modelling Language)** help to represent the system with diagrams, making it easier to visualize different aspects of the software.

### **2. FBS Representation**
- The **FBS (Function, Behaviour, Structure)** framework is used in software design to break down a system into three core concepts:
   1. **Function**: What the system or component is supposed to do (its purpose or role).
   2. **Behaviour**: How the system will behave in certain situations or scenarios.
   3. **Structure**: How the system is organized and what components (e.g., modules, classes) are involved in achieving its behaviour and functions.

- **FBS graphs** are often used to visualize these three elements in the design process. For example, in a music player:
   - The **function** could be to play music based on mood.
   - The **behaviour** might involve recognizing the user's emotional state through input.
   - The **structure** would involve the system's components, like mood-detection algorithms, music databases, etc.
   
- FBS helps designers conceptualize the solution at a high level before diving into detailed coding.

### **3. Unified Modelling Language (UML)**
- **UML (Unified Modelling Language)** is a standard way to visualize the structure and behaviour of software systems. It provides a variety of diagram types to represent different perspectives of the system:
   - **Structural Diagrams** (like Class Diagrams, Object Diagrams): These focus on the static parts of the system, i.e., its structure, data, and relationships between entities.
   - **Behavioural Diagrams** (like Sequence Diagrams, Use Case Diagrams): These illustrate how the system behaves over time or in specific scenarios, including interactions between objects, activities, and workflows.

**Key UML Diagrams**:
   - **Class Diagram**: Represents the system’s classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships. For example, in a mood-based music player, you might have a `User` class, a `Playlist` class, and a `Song` class, with associations showing which songs belong to which playlists.
   - **Sequence Diagram**: Shows the flow of control and message exchange between objects over time. In the case of the music player, it could show how a mood-detection system interacts with a song recommendation engine.
   - **State Machine Diagram**: Represents how an object transitions from one state to another. For instance, the player might transition from a `Waiting for Input` state to a `Playing Song` state when the user chooses a mood.

### **4. Purpose of FBS vs UML**
- **FBS and UML** serve different purposes in software design:
   - **FBS** is used in the **early conceptual phase** to frame what the software should do (high-level view).
   - **UML** is used in the **detailed design phase** to specify exactly how the system is structured and behaves. UML diagrams communicate precise details necessary for implementation, testing, and maintenance.

FBS helps designers think about what needs to be achieved, while UML helps in expressing how the system will work in practice.

### **5. Design Comprehension**
- **Design Comprehension** refers to understanding the design and structure of a software system.
   - This is a key skill for developers, particularly when dealing with large or complex systems.
   - It involves reading and understanding the different diagrams (like UML Class and Sequence Diagrams), understanding how the system works, and connecting different parts of the system.
   
- Developers need **domain knowledge** to understand the specific problem the software addresses (e.g., how a music player should operate) and **diagram knowledge** to interpret UML models correctly.

---

### **6. Challenges in Design Comprehension**
- Some of the challenges in understanding a software design include:
   - **Linking different diagrams**: Understanding how the static structure (like Class Diagrams) connects with the system's dynamic behaviour (like Sequence Diagrams).
   - **Understanding sequence of actions**: For example, how data moves between components when a user selects a mood and the system recommends a playlist.
   
- This comprehension is essential for implementing, debugging, and maintaining the software.

---

### **7. VeriSIM Learning Environment**
- **VeriSIM** is an educational tool that helps students and developers learn how to understand and trace UML diagrams.
   - It focuses on **scenario-based learning**, where users trace specific paths or flows through diagrams to better understand system design.
   - For example, in the case of a door-locking system, users can trace how the system transitions between states when locking or unlocking the door.
   
- VeriSIM promotes reflection and deeper understanding by helping students engage with both the **Class Diagrams** (static structure) and **Sequence Diagrams** (dynamic interactions).

---

### **8. Correctness in Software Design**
- **Correctness** in software design means that the design accurately meets the functional requirements of the system.
   - For instance, a mood-based music player should correctly identify a user’s mood and recommend appropriate songs based on that mood.
   - Evaluating correctness involves tracing specific use cases or scenarios to ensure the system behaves as expected.
   
- VeriSIM helps students practice ensuring that their designs meet the functional requirements through scenario-based evaluations.

### **9. Quality Attributes in Software Design**
- **Quality Attributes** are criteria used to evaluate how well a software system performs beyond just meeting functional requirements.
   
   **Key Quality Attributes** include:
   - **Reliability**: The software performs its functions without failure under specific conditions.
   - **Robustness**: The system can handle unexpected inputs or situations without crashing.
   - **Maintainability**: How easy it is to modify or update the software over time.
   - **Scalability**: The system’s ability to handle increased loads (e.g., more users or data).
   - **Usability**: The system's ease of use for end-users, particularly for non-technical users.
