### **Software Development Lifecycle: Design & Development Phase**  

#### **Recap: Requirements Gathering**  
In the previous discussion, we explored **identifying requirements** as the first step in software development. Now, we will look at the **importance of the design phase** before jumping into coding.  

#### **Why is Design Important?**  
Imagine a team implementing the **Amazon Pay** feature directly from the requirements without planning the design. This could lead to:  
- **Inconsistent implementation:** Different developers may have different ideas on how to implement the functionality.  
- **Code conflicts:** A developer may modify a function used by others, causing integration issues.  
- **Scalability problems:** Adding new features later becomes difficult without a clear structure.  
- **Delayed delivery:** A lack of coordination can lead to inefficiencies and delays.  

#### **The Role of the Design Phase**  
The **design phase** provides a **big-picture view** of the system, ensuring that all components interact smoothly. It involves:  
- **Organizing the code structure.**  
- **Planning how components interact.**  
- **Defining clear interfaces.**  
- **Ensuring future scalability.**  

#### **How Developers Work in the Development Phase**  
- **Collaborative coding:** Multiple developers work together on different features.  
- **Version control:** Tools like **GitHub** help manage code changes efficiently.  
- **Distributed development:** Developers work from different locations and time zones.  
- **Consistency:** Developers document their code and follow interface guidelines.  

#### **Understanding Interfaces in Software Development**  
An **interface** is a **description of what a function does** without detailing its internal implementation. It ensures:  
- **Clear input and output expectations.**  
- **Smooth collaboration between different modules.**  
- **Flexibility in modifying internal code without affecting external components.**  

**Example:**  
- **Interface A** takes inputs **W, X, and Y** and returns output **Z**.  
- Developers using this interface know what inputs to provide and what output to expect, even if the internal logic changes.  

#### **Summary**  
- **Jumping into coding without design leads to confusion and inefficiencies.**  
- **The design phase helps structure the system and plan interactions.**  
- **Development is collaborative and often distributed, requiring clear documentation.**  
- **Interfaces define how different components interact, ensuring smooth integration.**
