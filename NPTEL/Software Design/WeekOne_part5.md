### **Software Development Models: Waterfall, V-Model & Agile**  

#### **Recap of the Software Development Process**  
The **software development process** consists of several phases:  
1. **Requirements Gathering** – Identifying client needs and goals.  
2. **Design Phase** – Creating a **big-picture structure** of the system.  
3. **Development Phase** – Writing code based on the design.  
4. **Testing Phase** – Ensuring the software functions correctly.  
5. **Maintenance Phase** – Monitoring usage, updating, and fixing issues.  

This structured approach is known as the **Waterfall Model**, where each phase is completed **sequentially** before moving to the next.

## **1. Drawbacks of the Waterfall Model**  
The **sequential nature** of the Waterfall Model creates potential problems:  
- **High Costs & Delays:** If major changes are required **after development**, it increases **time and expenses**.  
- **Unclear Client Requirements:** Clients may **not fully understand** their needs initially, leading to changes later.  
- **Uncertain Feasibility:** Designers may struggle to create the **most effective or user-friendly design** without feedback.  

### **Example of Waterfall Model Issues**  
Imagine a software project taking **12 months**:  
- **2 months** for requirements gathering.  
- **3 months** for design.  
- **4 months** for development.  
- **3 months** for testing.  

After **a year of development**, the **client dislikes the software** due to:  
- **Unwanted features.**  
- **Poor user interface.**  
- **Changing requirements over time.**  

This means **starting over**, wasting **time and resources**.

## **2. V-Model (Verification & Validation Model)**  
To **improve the Waterfall Model**, the **V-Model** was introduced:  
- **Follows a structured approach like Waterfall.**  
- **Each development phase is linked to a corresponding testing phase.**  
- The process forms a **V-shape**, ensuring **early defect detection**.  

While it enhances verification, it **still follows a rigid structure**, making it difficult to adapt to **changing client needs**.

## **3. Iterative Software Development**  
To overcome **Waterfall & V-Model limitations**, **Iterative Software Development** is widely used today:  
- Software is developed in **multiple iterations** (small cycles).  
- **Key features are built first, tested, and refined** based on client feedback.  
- Clients can request **changes early**, reducing risks and costs.  
- Development continues until the **full product is completed**.  

### **Agile Methodology (A Popular Iterative Model)**  
Agile software development focuses on:  
- **Incremental development:** Delivering small, working **prototypes** instead of waiting until the end.  
- **Rapid feedback loops:** Frequent interaction with clients ensures the **right features are built**.  
- **Flexibility:** Changes can be made **quickly and efficiently**.  

#### **Agile Frameworks & Practices:**  
1. **Scrum & Kanban:** Organizing tasks for efficient workflow.  
2. **Sprints:** Short development cycles for continuous improvements.  
3. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Writing tests before code to ensure **quality**.  

Agile is an **umbrella term** for multiple frameworks and practices based on **collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement**.

## **Summary**  
- **Waterfall Model** follows a **rigid, sequential** process, leading to high costs for late-stage changes.  
- **V-Model** enhances verification by linking development to testing but remains **inflexible**.  
- **Iterative & Agile Development** allow for **continuous improvement**, faster feedback, and client-driven refinements.  
- **Agile frameworks** like **Scrum and Kanban** help teams **deliver software faster** with better adaptability.
