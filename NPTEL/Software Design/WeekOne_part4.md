### **Software Development Lifecycle: Testing & Maintenance**  

#### **Recap: Design & Development**  
Previously, we discussed **design and development** in software systems. Now, even though the software is implemented, it is **not yet ready for release**. Two critical phases remain: **Testing and Maintenance**.  

---

## **1. Testing Phase**  
### **Why is Testing Necessary?**  
Before releasing software, it must be tested to ensure it behaves **according to requirements**.  
- **Bugs & Defects:** Even after development, many software issues may still exist.  
- **Real-World Impact:** Studies show software bugs have led to massive financial losses:  
  - **2002:** Bugs cost the **US economy $60 billion**.  
  - **2016:** This number increased to **$1.1 trillion**.  
- **Preventing Catastrophes:** Even minor bugs can cause major failures if left unaddressed.  

### **Types of Testing**  
1. **Alpha Testing:**  
   - Performed by **internal employees** in a **controlled environment** (staging/lab).  
   - Goal: **Find as many issues as possible** before public release.  

2. **Beta Testing:**  
   - Conducted by **actual users** in **real-world scenarios**.  
   - Goal: **Test how the software performs in a real-life setting.**  

After thorough testing, the software is **released** to clients. However, development does not stop hereâ€”**monitoring and improvement** continue in the **maintenance phase**.

## **2. Maintenance Phase**  
### **Purpose of Maintenance**  
Once released, software requires continuous monitoring and improvements. The maintenance phase involves:  
- **Monitoring user interactions & errors.**  
- **Fixing issues that arise after release.**  
- **Enhancing or upgrading features.**  

### **Example: Amazon Pay**  
Even after launch, users may face various issues:  
- **Missed conditions causing failures.**  
- **UI bugs in specific browsers.**  
- **Unexpected use cases leading to errors.**  

The development team **identifies and resolves** these issues during the **maintenance phase**.  

---

## **Summary**  
- **Testing ensures software meets requirements and is free from critical bugs.**  
- **Alpha Testing (internal) and Beta Testing (real users) help identify defects.**  
- **Maintenance involves monitoring, fixing issues, and updating features.**  
- **Continuous improvement is key to successful software deployment.**
