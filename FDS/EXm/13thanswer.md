Scatter plots are graphical representations that show the relationship between two quantitative variables.

### **1. Positive Linear Relationship**
- **Definition**: When one variable increases, the other variable also increases proportionally. The data points align along a straight line with an upward slope.
- **Example**: The relationship between hours studied and test scores — generally, the more you study, the higher your score.
- **Visualization**: The points on the scatter plot would trend from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner.

### **2. Negative Linear Relationship**
- **Definition**: When one variable increases, the other variable decreases proportionally. The data points align along a straight line with a downward slope.
- **Example**: The relationship between the speed of a car and the time taken to cover a fixed distance — the faster the speed, the less time it takes.
- **Visualization**: The points on the scatter plot would trend from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

### **3. No Correlation**
- **Definition**: There is no apparent relationship between the two variables. The data points are scattered randomly without forming any discernible pattern.
- **Example**: The relationship between shoe size and intelligence — no logical connection exists.
- **Visualization**: The points on the scatter plot are spread out without any trend or alignment.

### **4. Nonlinear Relationship**
- **Definition**: The relationship between the two variables is not linear but follows a curve or some other non-linear pattern.
- **Example**: The relationship between age and height for children — height increases rapidly in early years and slows down as they approach adulthood, forming a curved pattern.
- **Visualization**: The points on the scatter plot would follow a curved or complex path instead of a straight line.

### **Purpose of Categorizing Relationships**
- Helps understand how variables are related.
- Aids in choosing the correct statistical models (e.g., linear regression for linear relationships or other models for non-linear patterns).
- Provides insight into whether one variable can be used to predict the other.
