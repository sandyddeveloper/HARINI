### (a)(i) Mode Calculation:
### **What is Mode?**

The **mode** is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. It represents the most common observation in the data. A dataset can have:

1. **No Mode**: If no value repeats, the dataset does not have a mode.
   - Example: 2, 4, 6, 8 (no value occurs more than once).

2. **One Mode**: If a single value occurs most frequently, the dataset is unimodal.
   - Example: 2, 3, 3, 4, 5 (mode is 3).

3. **More Than One Mode**:
   - **Bimodal**: Two values occur with the same highest frequency.
     - Example: 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5 (modes are 3 and 4).
   - **Multimodal**: More than two values have the highest frequency.
     - Example: 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4 (modes are 2, 3, and 4).

### **Can There Be Distributions with No Mode?**
Yes, distributions can have **no mode** if all values occur with the same frequency or if no value repeats. For example:
- Data: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (each value appears only once, so no mode exists).

### **Can There Be More Than One Mode?**
Yes, a dataset can have more than one mode if multiple values occur with the same highest frequency. For example:
- Data: 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4 (modes are 2 and 3, making the distribution bimodal).

**Data**: 26.3, 28.7, 27.4, 26.6, 27.4, 26.9

| **Value** | **Frequency** |
|-----------|---------------|
| 26.3      | 1             |
| 28.7      | 1             |
| 27.4      | 2             |
| 26.6      | 1             |
| 26.9      | 1             |

**Answer**: The mode is **27.4** (it occurs twice).

### (a)(ii) Median Calculation:

#### First Dataset: 2, 8, 7, 6
- **Steps**:
  1. Arrange data in ascending order: 2, 6, 7, 8.
  2. Find the middle value:
     - For an even number of observations, take the average of the two middle values: (6 + 7) / 2 = **6.5**.
  
| **Steps**            | **Values** |
|-----------------------|------------|
| Data (Sorted)         | 2, 6, 7, 8 |
| Middle Values         | 6, 7       |
| Median                | 6.5        |

#### Second Dataset: 3, 8, 9, 3, 1, 8
- **Steps**:
  1. Arrange data in ascending order: 1, 3, 3, 8, 8, 9.
  2. Find the middle value:
     - Average of the two middle values: (3 + 8) / 2 = **5.5**.

| **Steps**            | **Values**   |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| Data (Sorted)         | 1, 3, 3, 8, 8, 9 |
| Middle Values         | 3, 8         |
| Median                | 5.5          |

### (b) Multiple Linear Regression:

**Dataset:**

| **y**   | **x₁** | **x₂** |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 140     | 60     | 22     |
| 155     | 62     | 25     |
| 159     | 67     | 24     |
| 179     | 70     | 20     |
| 192     | 71     | 15     |
| 200     | 72     | 14     |
| 212     | 75     | 14     |
| 215     | 78     | 11     |

#### Regression Model:
The regression equation is of the form:

\[ y = b₀ + b₁x₁ + b₂x₂ \]

Using statistical software or manual calculations, you can fit the regression model. Let me know if you'd like detailed regression computations!
