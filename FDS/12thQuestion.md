### **Q12 (a)**
#### **(i) Explain Normal Curve and Z-Score**
- **Normal Curve**: A normal curve represents a bell-shaped, symmetric probability distribution. The peak corresponds to the mean, and the curve tails off on both sides. It is used to describe how values are distributed across a dataset.
- **Z-Score**: A Z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. It is calculated using:  
  Z= (X−μ)/σ
​
 
  Where:
  - X: Observed value  
  - μ: Mean  
  - σ: Standard deviation  

#### **(ii) Using Standard Normal Curve Table**
1. **Above a Z-score of 1.80**  
   From the Z-table, the cumulative probability for (Z = 1.80) is **0.9641**.  
   The proportion above is:  
   
   1 - 0.9641 = 0.0359
   

2. **Between the mean and a Z-score of 1.65**  
   From the Z-table, the cumulative probability for (Z = 1.65) is **0.9505**.  
   The proportion between the mean and \(Z = 1.65\) is:  
   
   0.9505 - 0.5 = 0.4505
   

3. **Between Z-scores of 0 and -1.96**  
   From the Z-table, the cumulative probability for (Z = -1.96) is **0.0250**.  
   The proportion between 0 and -1.96 is:  
   
   0.5 - 0.0250 = 0.4750

### **Q12 (b)**
#### **(i) Types of Variables**
- **Categorical (Qualitative)**: Variables that represent categories or groups (e.g., gender, color).  
- **Numerical (Quantitative)**: Variables representing numeric values. These can be further divided into:
  - **Discrete**: Countable values (e.g., number of children).  
  - **Continuous**: Measurable values (e.g., height, weight).



The **Age** data you provided is:

```
23, 27, 39, 49, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60
```

### Step-by-step Calculation of the Five-Number Summary:

1. **Ordered Data**:  
   The data is already in ascending order:

   ```
   23, 27, 39, 49, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60
   ```

2. **Minimum (Min)**:  
   The smallest value is **23**.

3. **Maximum (Max)**:  
   The largest value is **60**.

4. **Median (Q2)**:  
   The median is the average of the 5th and 6th values because there are 10 data points (an even number). The 5th and 6th values are **50** and **52**, so:

   \[
   \text{Median} = \frac{50 + 52}{2} = 51
   \]

5. **Q1 (First Quartile)**:  
   To find **Q1**, we look at the first half of the data (from 23 to 50):
   
   ```
   23, 27, 39, 49, 50
   ```
   
   The median of this set is the 3rd value, which is **39**. So, **Q1 = 39**.

6. **Q3 (Third Quartile)**:  
   To find **Q3**, we look at the second half of the data (from 52 to 60):
   
   ```
   52, 54, 56, 58, 60
   ```
   
   The median of this set is the 3rd value, which is **56**. So, **Q3 = 56**.

### Five-Number Summary:
- **Minimum (Min)** = 23
- **Q1 (First Quartile)** = 39
- **Median (Q2)** = 51
- **Q3 (Third Quartile)** = 56
- **Maximum (Max)** = 60

### Boxplot Interpretation:
The boxplot will have the following key points:
- **Minimum** at 23
- **Q1** at 39
- **Median** at 51
- **Q3** at 56
- **Maximum** at 60
