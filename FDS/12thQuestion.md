### **Q12 (a)**
#### **(i) Explain Normal Curve and Z-Score**
- **Normal Curve**: A normal curve represents a bell-shaped, symmetric probability distribution. The peak corresponds to the mean, and the curve tails off on both sides. It is used to describe how values are distributed across a dataset.
- **Z-Score**: A Z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. It is calculated using:  
  \[
  Z = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma}
  \]  
  Where:
  - \(X\): Observed value  
  - \(\mu\): Mean  
  - \(\sigma\): Standard deviation  

#### **(ii) Using Standard Normal Curve Table**
1. **Above a Z-score of 1.80**  
   From the Z-table, the cumulative probability for \(Z = 1.80\) is **0.9641**.  
   The proportion above is:  
   \[
   1 - 0.9641 = 0.0359
   \]

2. **Between the mean and a Z-score of 1.65**  
   From the Z-table, the cumulative probability for \(Z = 1.65\) is **0.9505**.  
   The proportion between the mean and \(Z = 1.65\) is:  
   \[
   0.9505 - 0.5 = 0.4505
   \]

3. **Between Z-scores of 0 and -1.96**  
   From the Z-table, the cumulative probability for \(Z = -1.96\) is **0.0250**.  
   The proportion between 0 and -1.96 is:  
   \[
   0.5 - 0.0250 = 0.4750
   \]

### **Q12 (b)**
#### **(i) Types of Variables**
- **Categorical (Qualitative)**: Variables that represent categories or groups (e.g., gender, color).  
- **Numerical (Quantitative)**: Variables representing numeric values. These can be further divided into:
  - **Discrete**: Countable values (e.g., number of children).  
  - **Continuous**: Measurable values (e.g., height, weight).

#### **(ii) Boxplot for Age**
To draw a boxplot for age, we calculate the five-number summary:
1. **Minimum**: 23  
2. **Q1 (25th Percentile)**: 29  
3. **Median (50th Percentile)**: 49  
4. **Q3 (75th Percentile)**: 57  
5. **Maximum**: 60
