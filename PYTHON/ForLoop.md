   Write a program that takes an integer \( N \) and prints all numbers from 1 to \( N \).

2. **Sum of First N Natural Numbers**  
   Write a program that calculates the sum of the first \( N \) natural numbers.

3. **Factorial of a Number**  
   Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number \( N \).

4. **Print Even Numbers up to N**  
   Write a program to print all even numbers from 1 to \( N \).

5. **Print Multiplication Table of a Number**  
   Write a program to print the multiplication table of a given number up to 10.

6. **Find the Sum of Digits**  
   Write a program to find the sum of digits of a given number.

7. **Check if a Number is Prime**  
   Write a program that checks if a given number is prime.

8. **Print All Prime Numbers up to N**  
   Write a program to print all prime numbers up to \( N \).

9. **Reverse a String**  
   Write a program to reverse a given string using a `for` loop.

10. **Fibonacci Sequence**  
    Write a program to print the Fibonacci sequence up to the \( N \)-th term.

11. **Count Occurrences of a Character in a String**  
    Write a program that takes a string and a character as input and counts the number of times the character appears in the string.

12. **Check if a String is a Palindrome**  
    Write a program to check if a given string is a palindrome.

13. **Calculate the Power of a Number**  
    Write a program to calculate \( x^y \) using a `for` loop, where \( x \) and \( y \) are inputs.

14. **Print Patterns**
