Here are some Python coding questions on variables, input, data types, type casting, and `if-else`:

### Variables & Getting Input
1. **Create a variable**: Write a program to create a variable called `name` and assign it your name. Then print it.
   
2. **User Input**: Write a program to ask the user for their age and print it back.

3. **Two Variables Addition**: Create two variables, `a` and `b`, with values 5 and 10. Add them and print the result.

4. **Greeting Message**: Write a program that asks for the user's name and prints a greeting message like `"Hello, <name>!"`.

5. **Favorite Color**: Write a program that takes the user's favorite color as input and prints a message like `"Your favorite color is <color>"`.

### Data Types
6. **Type Check**: Assign different values to a variable (like a number, string, and float) and use the `type()` function to print the data type.

7. **String Manipulation**: Write a program to take the user's name and print the name in all uppercase letters.

8. **Type Conversion Example**: Create a program that has two variables: `num1` (integer) and `num2` (string). Convert `num2` to an integer and print the sum of `num1` and `num2`.

### Type Casting
9. **Convert Float to Integer**: Ask the user for a decimal number and convert it to an integer, then print the result.

10. **String to Float**: Write a program that takes a number as a string from the user and converts it to a float.

11. **Age in Days**: Ask the user for their age (as an integer) and convert it to the total number of days approximately.

### If-Else
12. **Check Even or Odd**: Write a program that asks for a number from the user and prints if it is even or odd.

13. **Adult or Minor**: Ask the user for their age and check if they are an adult (18 or older) or a minor (under 18).

14. **Grade Checker**: Write a program that asks for a student's score and prints if they passed or failed (passing score is 50).

15. **Number Comparison**: Write a program that takes two numbers as input and prints the larger of the two.

16. **Positive, Negative, or Zero**: Ask the user for a number and check if it is positive, negative, or zero.
