ðŸ”¹ 1. Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, %)

Question:
Write a Java program that takes an integer n and:

Calculates the sum of the digits of n.

Calculates the product of the digits of n.

Finds the difference between the product and the sum of digits.

Finally, check if the difference is divisible by n.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Type Casting Operator

Question:
Write a Java program that:

Accepts a decimal number as input.

Explicitly casts it to an integer and a byte.

Shows how precision loss happens when converting a large floating-point number to byte.

Finally, prints the difference between implicit and explicit type casting in your own words.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)

Question:
Write a Java program that simulates bank transactions:

Start with a balance of â‚¹10,000.

Perform a series of transactions using assignment operators: deposit, withdraw, apply 5% interest, deduct â‚¹100 as fees.

Show the final balance after each operation.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Relational Operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)

Question:
Write a Java program that takes three numbers and:

Finds the largest and smallest number using relational operators.

Checks if all three numbers are equal or different.

Prints if the numbers are in ascending or descending order.



---

ðŸ”¹ 5. Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)

Question:
Write a Java program that checks if a given year is a leap year and if the year is a century year using logical operators:

Leap year rules: divisible by 4, not divisible by 100 unless also divisible by 400.

Print appropriate messages using logical expressions.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Conditional (Ternary) Operator (?:)

Question:
Write a Java program to check:

If a number is positive, negative, or zero using a ternary operator.

Use nested ternary operators to assign a grade based on marks:

>=90: A, >=75: B, >=50: C, <50: Fail.
