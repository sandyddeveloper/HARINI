###  Java Programming Questions

1. **Write a program that declares an integer variable and prints it using `System.out.print()` and `System.out.println()`. Observe the output.**

2. **Create a program with two string variables and print them on the same line using `print()`. Then print them on separate lines using `println()`.**

3. **Declare a float, double, and boolean variable inside the `main` method. Initialize them with valid values and print each using `println()`.**

4. **Declare three variables (int, char, and String) without initializing them. Then initialize them and print the values.**

5. **Write a program that declares and initializes multiple variables of the same type (e.g., `int x, y, z = 5;`). Print all of them.**

6. **Create a program with a global variable (static) and one local variable in `main`. Print both.**

7. **Declare a `String` variable, assign a value, and print its length using `println()` without using any operator.**

8. **Create a Java class that only contains variables declared and initialized inside the `main` method. Print all variables using `println()`.**

9. **Write a program that initializes a char variable and a boolean variable and prints both using `System.out.println()`.**

10. **Declare a variable of each primitive data type inside `main` and print their values.**

11. **Create a program with a non-primitive variable (like `String`) set to `null` and print it.**

12. **Declare a variable in `main`, initialize it, then reassign a new value to it and print both before and after reassignment.**

13. **Write a program where you declare a variable and only initialize it later in the same `main` method. Print it after initialization.**

14. **Declare a `String` variable and assign your name. Use `print()` to display it without a newline, then add another `print()` to display a greeting.**

15. **Create a program with only local variables that are declared, initialized, and printed inside the `main` method. No arithmetic or logical operations used.**
