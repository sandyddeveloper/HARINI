# Pipelining
## What is Pipelining?
Pipelining is an arrangement of the CPU’s hardware components to enhance the CPU’s overall performance. In a pipelined processor, procedures called "stages" are executed in parallel, allowing more than one instruction to be processed simultaneously.

### Example of Pipelining Efficiency

- **Without Pipelining:**
  - Total time: 9 minutes for 3 instructions
  - Average time per instruction: 9/3 = **3 minutes**

  ```plaintext
  I F S | | | | | |
  | | | I F S | | |
  | | | | | | I F S (9 minutes)
  ```

- **With Pipelining:**
  - Total time: 5 minutes for 3 instructions
  - Average time per instruction: 5/3 = **1.67 minutes**

  ```plaintext
  I F S | |
  | I F S |
  | | I F S (5 minutes)
  ```

Thus, pipelining increases the system’s efficiency.

## Design of a Basic Pipeline
In a pipelined processor, the pipeline consists of two ends:
- **Input End**: Where instructions enter the pipeline.
- **Output End**: Where instructions exit after processing.

### Key Features
- **Stages/Segments:** Each stage performs a specific operation.
- **Interface Registers:** Hold intermediate outputs between stages (also called latch or buffer).
- **Common Clock:** All pipeline stages operate in sync with a clock.

### Execution in a Pipelined Processor
#### Non-Overlapped Execution (Without Pipelining)
```plaintext
Stage / Cycle  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8
S1             | I1 |   |   |   | I2 |   |   |   
S2             |    | I1 |   |   |    | I2 |   |   
S3             |    |    | I1 |   |   |    | I2 |   
S4             |    |    |    | I1 |   |   |    | I2
Total time: 8 Cycles
```

#### Overlapped Execution (With Pipelining)
```plaintext
Stage / Cycle  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
S1             | I1 | I2 |   |   |   
S2             |    | I1 | I2 |   |   
S3             |    |    | I1 | I2 |   
S4             |    |    |    | I1 | I2
Total time: 5 Cycles
```

## Pipeline Stages
A RISC processor has a 5-stage instruction pipeline to execute instructions. These stages include:

1. **Instruction Fetch (IF):** The CPU fetches the instruction from memory.
2. **Instruction Decode (ID):** The instruction is decoded, and the register file is accessed.
3. **Instruction Execute (EX):** Arithmetic and logic operations are performed.
4. **Memory Access (MEM):** Memory operands are read or written.
5. **Write Back (WB):** The result is written back to the register.

## Performance of a Pipelined Processor

### Execution Time
For a pipeline with `k` segments and clock cycle time `Tp`, the execution time for `n` tasks is:
- **Pipelined Processor:**
  ```plaintext
  ET_pipeline = (k + n - 1) * Tp
  ```
- **Non-Pipelined Processor:**
  ```plaintext
  ET_non_pipeline = n * k * Tp
  ```

### Speedup
The speedup `S` is given by:
```plaintext
S = ET_non_pipeline / ET_pipeline
  = [n * k * Tp] / [(k + n - 1) * Tp]
  = [n * k] / [k + n - 1]
```
When `n >> k`, the speedup simplifies to:
```plaintext
S = k
```

### Efficiency
Efficiency is given by:
```plaintext
Efficiency = Speedup / Maximum Speedup
Efficiency = S / k
```

### Throughput
Throughput measures the number of instructions completed per unit time:
```plaintext
Throughput = n / [(k + n - 1) * Tp]
```

### Latency
Latency measures the time taken for a single instruction to complete execution:
```plaintext
Latency = Execution Time / Number of Instructions
```

## Advantages of Pipelining
1. **Increased Throughput:** Enables concurrent execution of multiple instructions, improving efficiency.
2. **Improved CPU Utilization:** Keeps all parts of the CPU busy.
3. **Higher Instruction Throughput:** Processes more instructions in a given time frame.
4. **Better Performance for Repeated Tasks:** Effective for repetitive instructions.
5. **Scalability:** Can be implemented in both simple and complex processors.

## Disadvantages of Pipelining
1. **Pipeline Hazards:**
   - **Data Hazards:** Dependencies between instructions.
   - **Control Hazards:** Branching issues.
   - **Structural Hazards:** Resource conflicts.
2. **Increased Complexity:** Managing stages and risks adds design complexity.
3. **Stall Cycles:** Hazards can introduce idle times, reducing efficiency.
4. **Instruction Latency:** Execution delay for individual instructions remains unaffected.
5. **Hardware Overhead:** Additional registers and control logic increase costs and complexity.

## Performance Metrics
1. **Throughput:** Measures overall processing speed and depends on:
   - Pipeline length.
   - Clock frequency.
   - Efficiency of instruction execution.
   - Pipeline hazards or stalls.
2. **Latency:** Measures delay for a single instruction and is influenced by:
   - Pipeline length and depth.
   - Clock cycle time.
   - Instruction dependencies.
   - Pipeline hazards.

# Virtual Memory in Computer Organization

## What is Virtual Memory?
Virtual memory is the separation of logical memory from physical memory. This partition allows programmers to utilize large virtual memory even when only limited physical memory is available. It creates the illusion of having a high memory capacity, simplifying programming as programmers no longer need to manage the limited physical memory directly.

### Key Features:
- Virtual memory provides the illusion of large memory to the programmer.
- Data is transferred between physical memory and slower storage (like disk) using a Memory Management Unit (MMU).
- The storage area used for virtual memory is often referred to as a **swap disk** or **swap file**.
- Accessing data from physical memory is faster than accessing data from the swap disk.

## Methods of Implementing Virtual Memory
Virtual memory can be implemented using two primary methods:

### 1. Paging
Paging is a memory management technique where small, fixed-length pages are allocated instead of large, variable-length contiguous blocks. In a paged system:
- Each process is divided into fixed-size **pages** (e.g., 4k bytes).
- Memory space is divided into blocks of equal size called **frames**.

#### Advantages of Paging:
1. Eliminates external fragmentation.
2. Simplifies swapping as pages and frames are of equal size.
3. Straightforward approach for memory management.

#### Disadvantages of Paging:
1. May cause **internal fragmentation**.
2. Page tables consume additional memory.
3. **Multi-level paging** may result in memory reference overhead.

### 2. Segmentation
Segmentation is the partitioning of memory into logical units called **segments**. Each segment represents a logically related unit, allowing for independent growth and sharing. Programs are treated as collections of segments rather than contiguous blocks of memory.

#### Key Features of Segmentation:
- Segments vary in size, unlike pages.
- A **segment table** is used to manage memory, containing the start address and size of each segment.
- Some systems allow segments to start at any address, while others impose restrictions. For instance, in the Intel X86 architecture, segment addresses must have `6000` as their four low-order bits.

#### Advantages of Segmentation:
- Provides logical grouping of related data and code.
- Allows segments to grow independently.
- Facilitates sharing of segments among processes.

## Comparison of Paging and Segmentation
| Feature                | Paging                          | Segmentation                      |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Size**               | Fixed-size pages                | Variable-size segments            |
| **Addressing**         | Pages mapped using page tables  | Segments mapped using segment tables |
| **Fragmentation**      | Internal fragmentation          | External fragmentation            |
| **Logical Division**   | Not related to program logic    | Related to program logic          |
